Hi, here is my Marviq Assessment.
Inside folders "Assignement_a" and "Assignement_c you can find results.
Third folder "Angular-marviq" include REST API and HttpClient using Angular. 
I understand that my skill level is not satisfactory at the moment, 
but I hope that when applying for a junior/starter I will get a chance 
to improve my knowledge by working and learning from Marviq professionals.
